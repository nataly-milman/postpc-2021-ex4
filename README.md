I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.
I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.


Answer.
I'll do what I did here when I couln't quite put a suitable random number to check the threshold.
I'll tweak the time value - for that we need it in a separate global/class variable.
We can set it to 200 ms (timeInterval = 0.2) or even less and run a few tests (some of them on big
numbers that'll take more than 200 ms, some of them - less) to check that it works.
